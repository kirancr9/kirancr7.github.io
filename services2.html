                <h3>Easy to Begin With</h3>
                <p>It is pretty easy, to begin with. Being easy to get started with is probably the first quality which makes Bootstrap very appealing.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="icon fa-laptop">
                <h3>LESS as Well as CSS Files</h3>

            <li class="icon fa-code">
                <h3>Mus Easily Customizable</h3>
                <p>Despite the fact that Bootstrap is designed in responsive 12-column grids, layouts, and components, it is also very easy to customize. Whether you need a fixed grid or a responsive one, it can be made possible by making a few changes</p>
            </li>
            <li class="icon fa-headphones">
                <h3>Responsive Utility Classes</h3>
                <p>Another prominent feature of Bootstrap is its responsive utility classes. Using responsive utility classes, a particular piece of content can be made to appear or hide only on devices depending on the size of the screen being used. </p>

                <h3>Bootstrap Templates</h3>
